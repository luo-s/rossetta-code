# Two integers N and M are said to be amicable pairs if N â‰  M and the sum of the proper divisors of N equals to M as well as the sum of the proper divisors of M equals to N.

# Example:

# 1184 and 1210 are an amicable pair, with proper divisors:

# 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 37, 74, 148, 296, 592 and
# 1, 2, 5, 10, 11, 22, 55, 110, 121, 242, 605 respectively.
# The sum of the divisors for the first value, 1184, is 1210 and the sum of the divisors for the second value, 1210, is 1184.

# Calculate and show here the Amicable pairs below 20,000 (there are eight).
